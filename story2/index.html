        I don’t think I’m alone in this but birthdays or any holidays trigger bad memories for me. 
        My dad always had some sort of meltdown on holidays. My worse birthday was my 16th birthday. 
        That was 16 years ago to the day of July 4 2018. 
        I want to finally tell someone outside of my family and my husband what happened.

        I am having chronic nightmares that getting worse and worse, leaving me exhausted the next day. 
        I dread going to sleep because it starts all over. I know you guys will understand more out of anyone else. 
        They are not about this event but things that I am terrified that will come to pass. 
        I am hoping by writing things down I am lancing the poison out.
